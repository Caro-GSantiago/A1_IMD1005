My client is a business that specializes in printing custom vinyl stickers and pins for artists and businesses. The site's purpose is to host their online business, as well as attract new clients.
Some colours were changed on the homepage for aesthetics and increased contrast. I made the "Shop Pins" button blue so it would stand out from the background more, and I made the footer black.
The reviews section was removed from the home page for the sake of time.
AI usage: none.
